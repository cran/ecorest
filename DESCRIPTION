Description: Three sets of data and functions for informing ecosystem restoration
    decisions, particularly in the context of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
    First, model parameters are compiled as a data set and associated metadata 
    for over 500 habitat suitability models developed by the U.S. Fish and 
    Wildlife Service (USFWS 1980) <https://www.fws.gov/policy/ESMindex.html>. 
    Second, functions for conducting habitat suitability analyses both for the
    models described above as well as generic user-specified model 
    parameterizations. Third, a suite of decision support tools for conducting 
    cost-effectiveness and incremental cost analyses (Robinson et al. 1995)
