Description: Three sets of data and functions for informing ecosystem restoration
    decisions, particularly in the context of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
    First, model parameters are compiled as a data set and associated metadata 
    for over 300 habitat suitability models developed by the U.S. Fish and 
    Wildlife Service (USFWS 1980, <https://www.fws.gov/policy-library/870fw1>).
    Second, functions for conducting habitat suitability analyses both for the 
    models described above as well as generic user-specified model parameterizations. 
    Third, a suite of decision support tools for conducting cost-effectiveness and 
    incremental cost analyses (Robinson et al. 1995, IWR Report 95-R-1, U.S. 
    Army Corps of Engineers).
